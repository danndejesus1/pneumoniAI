# Components

This folder contains all reusable React components.

## Structure
- `ui/` - Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.)
- `forms/` - Form-specific components for data input and validation
- Root level - Feature-specific components

## Naming Convention
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `ImageUpload.jsx`)
- Create an `index.js` file for easy imports when needed
