# Services

This folder contains API calls and external service integrations.

## Example services for Pneumonia AI:
- `aiService.js` - Functions to interact with AI model API
- `imageService.js` - Image processing and upload functions
- `apiClient.js` - Base API client configuration
- `authService.js` - Authentication-related functions (if needed)

## Best Practices
- Use async/await for API calls
- Handle errors appropriately
- Export functions as named exports
