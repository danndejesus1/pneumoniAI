# Pages

This folder contains page-level components that represent different routes/screens in your application.

## Example pages for Pneumonia AI:
- `Home.jsx` - Landing page
- `Upload.jsx` - Image upload page
- `Analysis.jsx` - Results/analysis display page
- `About.jsx` - Information about the AI model
- `Dashboard.jsx` - User dashboard (if user accounts are implemented)
